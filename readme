The led on the pin 3
Send "ON 123" to turn on led or relay on pin 3, Send "OFF 123" to turn it off.
Change 123 to your own password to prevent others from controlling the device

digital pins 10 and 11 on your Arduino boards are used as virtual RX and TX serial lines, RX goes to TX of model and vis-versa

I will add pictures later.
